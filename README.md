# Logistic-Regression-Alien-Predator_Dataset-Part-I
Logistic Regression with Neural Networks on Alien Predator Dataset 
I have used the following dataset from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/pmigdal/alien-vs-predator-images

This is a basic model with accuracy close to 60% , I will put links to project with updated accuracy soon.
Here is the link to the medium blog for this dataset:
